# SQL Project: Data Analysis for Zomato - A Food Delivery Company

## Overview

This project demonstrates my SQL problem-solving skills through the analysis of data for Zomato, a popular food delivery company in India. The project involves setting up the database, importing data, handling null values, and solving a variety of business problems using complex SQL queries.

## Project Structure

- **Database Setup:** Creation of the `zomato_db` database and the required tables.
- **Data Import:** Inserting sample data into the tables.
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling null values and ensuring data integrity.
- **Business Problems:** Solving 20 specific business problems using SQL queries.

## Database Setup
```sql
create database Zomato;
```

### 1. Dropping Existing Tables
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS deliveries;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Orders;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS customers;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS restaurants;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS riders;

-- 2. Creating Tables

CREATE TABLE customers (
    customer_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    reg_date DATE
);

CREATE TABLE restaurants (
    restaurant_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    restaurant_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    city VARCHAR(50),
    opening_hours VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id SERIAL,
    customer_id BIGINT UNSIGNED,
    restaurant_id BIGINT UNSIGNED,
    order_item VARCHAR(260),
    order_date DATE NOT NULL,
    order_time TIME NOT NULL,
    order_status VARCHAR(30) DEFAULT 'Pending',
    total_amount DECIMAL(10 , 2 ) NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id)
        REFERENCES customers (customer_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (restaurant_id)
        REFERENCES restaurant (restaurant_id)
);
alter table orders add primary key(order_id);

CREATE TABLE riders (
    rider_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    rider_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    sign_up DATE
);

CREATE TABLE deliveries (
    delivery_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    order_id INT,
    delivery_status VARCHAR(80),
    delivery_time TIME,
    rider_id BIGINT UNSIGNED,
    FOREIGN KEY (rider_id)
        REFERENCES riders (rider_id)
);
SHOW CREATE TABLE orders;
alter table deliveries modify column order_id bigint unsigned;
ALTER TABLE deliveries 
ADD FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(order_id);
```

## Data Import
'''
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'local_infile';
SET GLOBAL local_infile = 1;

LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'D:\\Projects\\Zomato\\customers.csv'

ENCLOSED BY '"'

'''


## Checking Null Values

Before performing analysis, I ensured that the data was clean and free from null values where necessary. For instance:

```sql
SELECT 
    *
FROM
    customers
WHERE
    reg_date IS NULL;
SELECT 
    *
FROM
    restaurants
WHERE
    city IS NULL OR opening_hours IS NULL;
SELECT 
    *
FROM
    orders
WHERE
    order_item IS NULL;
SELECT 
    *
FROM
    riders
WHERE
    sign_up IS NULL;
SELECT 
    *
FROM
    deliveries
WHERE
    delivery_time IS NULL;


```

## Business Problems Solved

### 1. Write a query to find the top 5 most frequently ordered dishes by customer called "Vikram Singh" in the last 1 year(2023)

```sql
SELECT
    customer_name,
    order_item AS dish,
    total_orders
FROM (
    SELECT 
        c.customer_name,
        o.order_item,
        COUNT(*) AS total_orders,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS ranks
    FROM orders o
    JOIN customers c ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
    WHERE 
	 order_date < '2024-01-01'
        AND c.customer_name = 'Vikram Singh'
    GROUP BY c.customer_name, o.order_item
) ranked_dishes
WHERE ranks <= 5
ORDER BY total_orders DESC;
```

### 2. Popular Time Slots
-- Question: Identify the time slots during which the most orders are placed. based on 2-hour intervals

```sql
SELECT 
    CONCAT(start_time, ' - ', end_time) AS time_range,
    order_count
FROM
    (SELECT 
        FLOOR(EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) / 2) * 2 AS start_time,
            FLOOR(EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) / 2) * 2 + 2 AS end_time,
            COUNT(*) AS order_count
    FROM
        orders
    GROUP BY 1 , 2
    ORDER BY 1 ASC) AS t1;
```

### 3. Order Value Analysis
-- Question: Find the average order value per customer who has placed more than 750 orders.
-- Return customer_name, and aov(average order value)

```sql
SELECT 
    c.customer_name, AVG(o.total_amount) AS aov
FROM
    orders AS o
        JOIN
    customers AS c ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY customer_name
HAVING COUNT(order_id) > 750;

```

### 4. High-Value Customers
-- Question: List the customers who have spent more than 100K in total on food orders.
-- return customer_name

```sql
SELECT 
    c.customer_name, SUM(o.total_amount) AS spent
FROM
    orders AS o
        JOIN
    customers AS c ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY 1
HAVING SUM(o.total_amount) > 100000;

```

### 5. Orders Without Delivery
-- Question: Write a query to find orders that were placed but not delivered. 
-- Return each restuarant name, city and number of not delivered orders 
```sql

SELECT 
    restaurant_name,
    city,
    COUNT(delivery_status) AS not_delivered
FROM
    restaurants r
        JOIN
    orders o ON r.restaurant_id = o.restaurant_id
        JOIN
    deliveries d ON o.order_id = d.order_id
WHERE
    delivery_status = 'Not delivered'
GROUP BY 1 , 2
ORDER BY COUNT(delivery_status) DESC;

```

-- Rank restaurants by their total revenue from the last year, including their name, 
-- total revenue, and rank within their city.

select restaurant_name, city,
rank() over( partition by city order by sum(total_amount)) as city_rnk,
sum(total_amount) as revenue 
from restaurants r join orders o on r.restaurant_id=o.restaurant_id where order_date < '2024-01-01'
group by restaurant_name,city order by city,city_rnk ;

```

### 7. Most Popular Dish by City: 
-- Identify the most popular dish in each city based on the number of orders.
```sql
with rnk_tbl as(
select city,order_item as dish,count(order_id) as ordr_qnt, 
rank () over( partition by city order by count(order_id) desc) as rnk from orders o 
join restaurants r on r.restaurant_id=o.restaurant_id
group by city,order_item )
select city,dish, ordr_qnt from rnk_tbl where rnk=1;

```

### 8. Customer Churn: 
-- Find customers who havenâ€™t placed an order in 2024 but did in 2023.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
    customer_name
FROM
    customers c
        JOIN
    orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
